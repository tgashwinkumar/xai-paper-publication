# Why - XAI?

Explainable AI is one of the key requirements for implementing responsible AI, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability.³ To help adopt AI responsibly, organizations need to embed ethical principles into AI applications and processes by building AI systems based on trust and transparency.


## Used for Continuos Model Evaluation :
With explainable AI, a business can troubleshoot and improve model performance while helping stakeholders understand the behaviors of AI models. Investigating model behaviors through tracking model insights on deployment status, fairness, quality and drift is essential to scaling AI. Continuous model evaluation empowers a business to compare model predictions, quantify model risk and optimize model performance. Displaying positive and negative values in model behaviors with data used to generate explanation speeds model evaluations.


# Some pre-built Models for XAI
***
## FACET : 
FACET is an open source library for human-explainable AI. It combines sophisticated model inspection and model-based simulation to enable better explanations of your supervised machine learning models.

It has 3 main features :

* ### Model Inspection

    **FACET** introduces a new algorithm to quantify dependencies and
    interactions between features in ML models. 
    This new tool for **human-explainable** AI adds a new, global
    perspective to the observation-level explanations
    provided by the popular **SHAP** approach. 

* ### Model Simulation

    FACET’s model simulation algorithms use ML models for virtual experiments to help identify scenarios that optimise predicted outcomes. To quantify the uncertainty in simulations, FACET utilises a range of bootstrapping algorithms including ***stationary and stratified bootstraps***.

* ### Enhanced Machine Learning Workflow

    FACET offers an efficient and transparent machine learning workflow, enhancing scikit-learn's tried and tested pipelining paradigm with new capabilities for model selection, inspection, and simulation. FACET also introduces ***"sklearndf"*** [documentation](https://bcg-gamma.github.io/sklearndf/index.html) an augmented version of scikit-learn with enhanced support for pandas data frames that ensures end-to-end traceability of features.

## XAI - An eXplainability toolbox for machine learning

**XAI** is a Machine Learning library that is designed with AI explainability in its core. XAI contains various tools that enable for analysis and evaluation of data and models. The XAI library is maintained by **The Institute for Ethical AI & ML**, and it was developed based on the 8 principles for Responsible Machine Learning.
