## This interface dynamically produces the following results:

- Epidemic curves (number of incidents) as a function of time t
- Estimated R (Reproductive number) as a function of time t with 95% confidence intervals.

This is calculated using sliding weekly windows, with a parametric serial interval based on a mean of μsi=4.8 and standard deviation σsi=2.3
