# Possible Approaches

## #1

Make sure if Covid forecasting for the number of cases is predictable using **Random walks**

---

## #2

How ARIMA Model + Extra tree classifier/Random tree classifier was chosen for the forecasting model, how we think it failed and how other models failed using **xAi**

---

## #3

Unit root testing for selecting suitable forecasting models

---

## #4

Adjusting the values of **parameters pdq** for the provided current Covid forecasting ARIMA Model
