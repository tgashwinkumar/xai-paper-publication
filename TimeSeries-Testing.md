# Time Series Testing

## Unit root test

A unit root test tests whether a time series is not stationary and consists of a unit root in time series analysis. The presence of a unit root in time series defines the null hypothesis, and the alternative hypothesis defines time series as stationary.

Mathematically, $y_t = D_t + z_t + \epsilon_t$ where
- $D_t$ is the deterministic component.
- $z_t$ is the stochastic component.
- $\epsilon_t$ is the stationary error process.

The unit root testâ€™s basic concept is to determine whether the zt (stochastic component ) consists of a unit root or not.

There are various tests which include unit root tests.

- Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.
- Phillips-perron test.
- KPSS test.
- ADF-GLS test
- Breusch-godfrey test.
- Ljung-Box test.
- Durbin-watson test.
